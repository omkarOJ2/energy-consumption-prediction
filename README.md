Linear Regression model for energy consumption prediction
Energy Consumption Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

Overview
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression to predict energy consumption based on a single independent variable. By analyzing historical data, the model helps forecast future energy usage, optimizing consumption patterns and improving efficiency.

Features
âœ” Loads and explores energy consumption data
âœ” Visualizes energy trends using scatter plots
âœ” Splits data into training and testing sets
âœ” Trains a Simple Linear Regression model
âœ” Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score
âœ” Plots the regression line to visualize predictions

Use Cases
This model can be applied to various energy-related scenarios, such as:
ðŸ“Œ Predicting electricity consumption based on temperature changes
ðŸ“Œ Estimating HVAC energy usage based on external weather conditions
ðŸ“Œ Forecasting appliance power consumption based on operational hours
ðŸ“Œ Optimizing energy efficiency in smart homes and buildings

Libraries Used
ðŸ“Œ NumPy â€“ For numerical computations

ðŸ“Œ Pandas â€“ For data handling and manipulation

ðŸ“Œ Matplotlib â€“ For visualizing trends

ðŸ“Œ Scikit-learn â€“ For building and evaluating the regression model

Dataset
The dataset consists of two key variables:

Independent Variable (X) â€“ The predictor (e.g., temperature, appliance usage hours, occupancy levels)

Dependent Variable (Y) â€“ The response variable, i.e., energy consumption (kWh)

Workflow
â¿¡ Import necessary libraries
â¿¢ Load and visualize the energy dataset
â¿£ Preprocess the data (handle missing values if any)
â¿¤ Split the data into training and testing sets
â¿¥ Train the Simple Linear Regression model
â¿¦ Evaluate model performance
â¿§ Visualize energy consumption predictions with a regression line
